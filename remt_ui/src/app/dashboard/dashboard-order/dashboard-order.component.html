	<p class="card-body">
		The user interface for the real estate management website would need to provide access to the seven different user
		types, each with their own specific permissions and functionalities.
	</p>
	<p class="card-body">
		For the main administrators, they would need to have access to the entire system and would need to be able to manage
		the different user types. This would require a dashboard that provides an overview of the entire system.
	</p>

	<p class="card-body">For the local government administrators, they would need to have the ability to add landlords and
		properties in their
		respective areas. The user interface for this user type would include a form for adding new landlords, with fields
		for
		name, property address, and owner name.</p>

	<p class="card-body">For landlords, they would need to have access to a dashboard that shows information on their
		properties and tenants.
		They should be able to add and remove tenants, assign or remove caretakers, and create invoices for their tenants.
		The
		user interface for landlords should also include a feature for checking the rental history of their tenants.</p>

	<p class="card-body">Caretakers would need a dashboard that allows them to manage their assigned properties and
		tenants. They would need to
		be able to add and remove tenants, create invoices, and check tenant histories.</p>

	<p class="card-body">Real estate brokers would need a feature for recruiting tenants on behalf of landlords. This
		could be a search feature
		that allows tenants to search for properties and landlords to view potential tenants.</p>

	<p class="card-body">Tenants would need access to a dashboard that allows them to manage their rental payments and
		view their rental
		history. They should be able to request invoices, set up automatic payments, and view their payment history.</p>

	<p class="card-body">Lenders would need access to a feature that allows them to verify the address of a tenant. This
		could be a search
		feature that allows them to search for a tenant by their ID number and view their address.</p>

	<p class="card-body">The overall user interface would need to be designed to be user-friendly and intuitive. It should
		provide clear and
		concise instructions on how to use the different features and functionalities of the system. The user interface
		should
		also be designed to be mobile responsive, allowing users to access the system from a variety of devices.</p>
