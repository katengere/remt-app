In fact, only 2% of our brain is designed to retain memory in our consciousness. The rest is all subconscious. The brain WANTS to create habits so that we\u2019re not required to use up conscious effort. It only follows then that performance is achieved not by what our conscious mind tells us, but largely through the subconscious cues that guide us throughout our day.

However... just for the fun of it, here\u2019s a good story... One of my favorite real life examples of the dangers of habit creation was depicted in the recent movie, The Wolf of Wall Street. It\u2019s based on the true story of Jordan Belfort, a New York stockbroker who ran a firm that engaged in securities fraud and corruption on Wall Street in the 1990s, and ended up spending years in jail.

He says, \u201cYou don\u2019t lose your soul all at once, you lose it a little bit at a time, incrementally. When I lost my ethical way it did not start off that way. It\u2019s like these tiny imperceptible steps over the line. Each time your line of morality moves a bit, and before you know it you\u2019re doing things you thought you would never do and it seems perfectly okay. What seems amazing first becomes commonplace after a period of time and you become numb. Day one it\u2019s one thing, and a year later it\u2019s completely off the rails.\u201d Watch this video from 7:30 to 8:52 minutes, to see Jordan Belfort describe this.
